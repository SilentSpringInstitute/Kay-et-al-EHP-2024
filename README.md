### Scripts
The folder "./outputs/" will be created in the first script MCList_refs

Scripts should be run in order:
- 1_MCList_refs.R: compile list of rodent mammary carcinogens (MCs)
- 2_gentox_chems.R: compile chemical genotoxicity databases
- 3_BCrelevant_chem_effects.R: compile results of rodent cancer bioassays without mammary tumors (putative non-MCs), E2/P4 synthesis, and ER agonism assays; construct list of breast cancer-relevant chemicals with Key Characteristic (steroidogenic, ER agonistic, and genotoxic) activities; construct list with KCs of MCs and putative non-MCs
- 4_BCRel-MGdev_comparison.R: compare lists of BC-relevant chemicals and mammary gland developmental toxicants and their genotoxic/endocrine-disrupting properties
- 5_BCRC_tables_figures.R: create Excel file with supplemental tables created in R, and figures 2 and 3 for the paper
